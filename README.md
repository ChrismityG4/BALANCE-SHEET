# BALANCE SHEET - RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN COURSE

A simple HTML & CSS build of a Balance Sheet.

There was a few new features I learnt during this build, however they are similar to the features I was already versed in so it was easily adopted.

This is the third notable proof of work from the FREE CODE CAMP COURSE â€“ RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN.
